    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Pitt PokeResearch was created to show high level research tasks in the Pittsburgh area. When hunting research, it can be frusterating searching
      through Discord, Facebook or other social networks looking for updated Research for the day. Many of us travel through many of these regions 
      throughout the day. This was very apparent when trying to gather Spinda tasks in August. Our hope is that to have a single place to see and report 
      research, and to be able to see it on a map.</p>
    
    <h2>User Guide</h2>
    <h3>iOS and Android</h3>
    <p>You will need a Google Account to Add Markers. Viewing does not require a login.</p>
    <p><b>To Refresh Map Data: </b><br>Click the Refresh icon on the bottom right. Loaded map data is up to date, but you may want to 
      refresh once per session to check for newly submitted tasks during your session.</p>
    <p><b>To Add a Marker: </b><br>Long press on the map. I suggest doing this as zoomed in as you can.</p>
    <p><b>To Delete a Marker: </b><br>Click the marker, click the callout box and get the information modal. If you own the marker, you can then delete it by clicking the delete button.</p>
    <p><b>To Move a Marker: </b><br>Click on, hold and drag the marker to a new location. If it is your marker, the location will update.</p>
    <h3>iOS</h3>
    <p>You will find two icons on the botom right. Once is to refresh map data, one is to find your location.</p>
    <p><b>Find Your Location</b><br>Your location is shown as a blue dot if you allow location information to be shared.</p>
    <p><b>Toggling on your location</b><br>Click the location arrow on the bottom right. When this turns dark black, the map will follow you.</p>
    
    <h3>Android Install and Potential Issues</h3>

    <p><b>Install</b><br>You will have to bypass any security warnings since this is not yet in the Play Store. This is beta software and over time may have errors.</p>
    <p><b>Map Markers Not Showing</b><br>On load, markers may not show. Try clicking the refresh button. If they still don't show up, it may be a 
      new issue with newer Android software. We are working on a fix</p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>The software is limited to within 50 miles of Pittsburgh, PA for reasons of software scale.</p>
